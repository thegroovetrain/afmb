# afmb - (Another F*!%ing Micro Blog)

There is no license, and at least for now the app's purpose is moot if I allow any additional contributors.

However, If any part of this code helps you solve a problem you are welcome to use or reference it.

Ideas may be free, and computers may be a science, but one's implementation of an idea on a computer is an art. There are many ways to make a microblog and I encourage you to research them all, and use whatever method makes sense to you.

## Libraries

* flask
* flask-pymongo
