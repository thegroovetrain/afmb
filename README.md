# afmb - (Another F*!%ing Micro Blog)

There is no license, and at least for now the app's purpose is moot if I allow any additional contributors.

However, If any part of this code helps you solve a problem you are welcome to use or reference it.

Ideas may be free, and computers may be a science, but one's implementation of an idea of a computer is an extension of oneself - an art. There are so many ways to make a microblog and I encourage you to use whatever method feels natural to you.
