# afmb - (Another F*!%ing Micro Blog)

There is currently no license, and at least for now the app's purpose is moot if I allow any additional contributors. Effectively, its mine and you can't have it (until further notice).

However, If any part of this code helps you solve a problem you are welcome to use or reference it.

If that seems contradictory in any way, I don't care.

Ideas may be free, and computers may be a science, but one's implementation of an idea on a computer is an art. There are many ways to make a microblog and I encourage you to research them all, and use whatever method makes sense to you.
